# Sampling
Assignment03 - Sampling UCS654: Predictive Analytics using Statistics
In this 5 different ML models have been applied to a credit card dataset,which are as follows:

1)LogisticRegression 

2)KNeighborsClassifier

3)RandomForestClassifier

4)SVC

5)ExtraTreesClassifier

##
The following formula has been applied:
n = (Z^2*(p(1 â€“ p))/(E^2))

Where,
n is the sample size,
Z(Confidence Level): 1.96
p: proportion of population 
E: estimated error (0.025)


##
Following sampling techniques are used:

1)RandomUnderSampler

2)RandomOverSampler

3)OneSidedSelection

4)BorderlineSMOTE

5)NeighbourhoodCleaningRule

##
And here is the accuracy of the different models on different sample
